## Introduction
The aim of the analysis is to report on which variables were chosen from the best subset selection and lasso methods. The dataset under consideration is on the quality of Red Wine.

## Data Description
This dataset is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

### Content
**Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):**
1. fixed acidity
2. volatile acidity
3. citric acid
4. residual sugar
5. chlorides
6. free sulfur dioxide
7. total sulfur dioxide
8. density
9. pH
10. sulphates
11. alcohol

**Output variable (based on sensory data):**
12. quality (score between 0 and 10)
